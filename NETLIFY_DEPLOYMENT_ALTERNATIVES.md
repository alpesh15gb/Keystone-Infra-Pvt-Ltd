## SOLUTION 3: RENDER

**Render Static Site:**
- Free static site hosting

- Custom domains supported

**Deploy to Render:**
1. Go to: https://render.com
2. Create "Static Site"
3. Connect GitHub repository

5. Publish directory: `dist/public`

## SOLUTION 4: REPLIT DEPLOYMENTS (EASIEST)

**Use Replit's Deploy Button:**
