# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FINAL SOLUTION

## ✅ BUILD SCRIPT CREATED AND TESTED

Created custom `vercel-build.js` that works with the existing Vite configuration:

```javascript
// Uses project root vite build (preserves aliases and configuration)
const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync('npx vite build');
```

## VERIFICATION COMPLETE

- ✅ Build script tested successfully  
- ✅ Static files generated in `dist/public/`
- ✅ All React components and assets bundled
- ✅ No path resolution errors

## UPDATED VERCEL.JSON

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "node vercel-build.js",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public", 
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

```bash
# Push the final fix to GitHub
git add vercel-build.js vercel.json VERCEL_FINAL_SOLUTION.md
git commit -m "Add custom Vercel build script - final fix"
git push origin main
```

## WHAT THIS SOLVES

1. **Entry Module Error**: Custom build script bypasses Rollup's entry resolution issues
2. **Path Aliases**: Uses existing vite.config.ts that has correct @ aliases configured  
3. **Build Output**: Generates static files in correct `dist/public/` directory
4. **Vercel Compatibility**: Works within Vercel's build environment constraints

## EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment:
- ✅ Build will complete without "Could not resolve entry module" error
- ✅ Website loads at https://keystoneinfra.vercel.app/
- ✅ All React routing and components work properly
- ✅ Images and assets serve correctly

This custom build approach works around Vercel's limitations while preserving the existing project structure.
