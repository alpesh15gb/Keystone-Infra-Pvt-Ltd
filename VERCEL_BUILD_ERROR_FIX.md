# Vercel Build Error Fix - Entry Module Resolution

## ✅ ERROR IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

**Build Error:** `Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"`

**Root Cause:** Vercel's build environment couldn't find the entry point because it was looking in the wrong directory structure.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

1. **Created root index.html** - Added entry point at project root for Vercel compatibility
2. **Added framework detection** - Updated `vercel.json` to specify Vite framework
3. **Maintained build config** - Output directory still set to `dist/public`

## FILES CHANGED

### New vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build", 
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### New index.html (root):
- Entry point for Vercel build system
- Points to correct TypeScript entry: `/client/src/main.tsx`
- Includes all meta tags and SEO optimization

## VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **Local build test:** ✅ Confirmed build generates static files correctly
2. **Entry resolution:** ✅ Root index.html provides proper entry point  
3. **Framework detection:** ✅ Vercel will recognize as Vite project

## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

```bash
# Push the fixes to GitHub
git add index.html vercel.json VERCEL_BUILD_ERROR_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build error - add root entry point"
git push origin main
```

## EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment:
- ✅ Build will complete successfully (no more "Could not resolve entry module" error)
- ✅ Website will load at https://keystoneinfra.vercel.app/
- ✅ All React components and routing will work properly
- ✅ Static assets and images will serve correctly

The build error is now resolved with proper entry module configuration for Vercel's build environment.
