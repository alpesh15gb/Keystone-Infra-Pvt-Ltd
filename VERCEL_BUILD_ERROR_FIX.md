# VERCEL BUILD ERROR FIX - Entry Module Issue

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Vercel build failing with: `Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"`

**Root Cause:** The main vite.config.ts has complex Replit-specific configuration that sets `root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client")` but our index.html is in the project root, not in client folder.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Created Simplified Vite Config
- Created `vite.config.simple.ts` with proper root configuration
- Removed Replit-specific plugins that cause build issues
- Set correct paths for deployment environment

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build --config vite.config.simple.ts",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## ALTERNATIVE DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Railway (Recommended - Zero Config)
1. Visit: https://railway.app
2. Deploy from GitHub repo: `alpesh15gb/keystoneinfra`
3. Railway auto-detects and builds correctly
4. No configuration files needed

### Render (Static Site)
1. Visit: https://render.com
2. Create new "Static Site"
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Publish directory: `dist/public`

### GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: GitHub Actions
3. Use "Static HTML" workflow
4. Free hosting with custom domain support

## RECOMMENDATION

While I've fixed the Vercel configuration, **Railway remains the most reliable option** as it requires zero configuration and handles complex project structures automatically.

The Vercel fix should work, but Railway eliminates all configuration issues entirely.
