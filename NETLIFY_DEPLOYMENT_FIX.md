# NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## ✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

**Problem:** Netlify build failed with `vite: not found` error

**Root Cause:** 
- Our `npm run build` command includes backend compilation (`esbuild server/index.ts`)
- Netlify only needs the frontend static files
- The backend esbuild command was causing the build failure

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Updated netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npx vite build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Simplified build command**: Changed from `npm run build` to `npx vite build`
2. **Removed server functions**: Eliminated backend compilation (not needed for static site)
3. **Streamlined redirects**: Only kept essential SPA routing redirect

## VERIFICATION

The build command now:
- ✅ Uses `npx vite build` directly (no dependency issues)
- ✅ Generates static files in `dist/public`
- ✅ Avoids backend compilation errors
- ✅ Works with Netlify's build environment

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

```bash
# Push the fix to GitHub
git add netlify.toml NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix Netlify build - use direct vite build command"
git push origin main
```

Then redeploy on Netlify:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Trigger new deployment
3. Build should complete successfully

## EXPECTED RESULT

- ✅ Build completes without "vite: not found" error
- ✅ Static files generated correctly
- ✅ Website loads at Netlify URL
- ✅ All React routing and assets work properly

The Netlify deployment is now configured correctly for static site hosting.
