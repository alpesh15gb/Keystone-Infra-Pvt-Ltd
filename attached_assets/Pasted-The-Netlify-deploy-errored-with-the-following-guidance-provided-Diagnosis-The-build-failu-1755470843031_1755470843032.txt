The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure occurred during the 'building site' stage with the error message "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2".

**Solution:**
1. Check the build script to identify the specific issue causing the non-zero exit code.
2. Ensure all necessary configurations and dependencies are correctly set up for the build script to execute successfully.
3. Verify that the required packages are present in the `package.json` file and have been committed to the repository.

If the issue persists, further debugging of the build script may be necessary to identify the root cause of the failure.
