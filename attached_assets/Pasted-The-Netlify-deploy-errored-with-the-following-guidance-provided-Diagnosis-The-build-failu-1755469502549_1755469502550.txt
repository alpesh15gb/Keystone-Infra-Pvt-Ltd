The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the `vite` command not being found during the build process, which leads to a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
1. Since the `vite` command is not found, you need to ensure that Vite is listed as a dependency in your project.
2. Verify that Vite is included in your `package.json` file by running `npm list vite` locally.
3. If Vite is missing from your `package.json`, you should add it as a dependency by running `npm install vite --save` in your project directory.
4. Make sure to commit the changes to your repository.
5. After adding Vite as a dependency in your project, trigger a new build on Netlify to see if the issue is resolved.

If Vite is still not recognized after following these steps, you may need to review your build setup or configuration to ensure Vite is properly installed and accessible during the build process.
