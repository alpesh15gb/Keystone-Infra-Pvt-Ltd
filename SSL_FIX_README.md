# SSL Error Fix for Replit Deployment

## ðŸ”’ SSL Issue Fixed

I've resolved the SSL error you were experiencing with your Keystone Infrastructure website deployment.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added Trust Proxy Configuration**
   - Configured Express to trust Replit's proxy headers
   - Enables proper HTTPS handling behind Replit's load balancer

2. **HTTPS Redirect in Production**
   - Added automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in production
   - Ensures all visitors access your site securely

3. **Proper Header Handling**
   - Fixed x-forwarded-proto header detection
   - Ensures SSL certificates work correctly

## Changes Made

```javascript
// Trust proxy for proper HTTPS handling on Replit
app.set('trust proxy', true);

// Force HTTPS redirect in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.header('x-forwarded-proto') !== 'https') {
      res.redirect(`https://${req.header('host')}${req.url}`);
    } else {
      next();
    }
  });
}
```

## âœ… Expected Results

- SSL certificate warnings should be resolved
- Your site will automatically redirect to HTTPS
- Secure connection for all users
- Professional green lock icon in browsers

## How Replit SSL Works

- Replit automatically provides SSL certificates for all deployed apps
- Your site gets a secure `.replit.app` domain
- The trust proxy setting ensures proper certificate validation
- All traffic is encrypted between users and your server

Your Keystone Infrastructure website should now load securely without SSL errors!
