# VERCEL QUICK FIX - Keystone Infra

## CURRENT ISSUE
Your Vercel deployment at `https://keystoneinfra.vercel.app/` is still showing 404 error.

## SIMPLE SOLUTION

I've simplified the `vercel.json` to the most basic configuration that Vercel supports:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public", 
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Push updated vercel.json to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Simplify Vercel configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Manual redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Find your "keystoneinfra" project
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

3. **Alternative: Create new deployment**
   If issues persist:
   - Delete current Vercel project
   - Create new project from same GitHub repo
   - Let Vercel auto-detect settings

## EXPECTED RESULT
After pushing the simplified config and redeploying:
- ✅ Your website should load at https://keystoneinfra.vercel.app/
- ✅ All pages and assets should work
- ✅ No more 404 errors

## BACKUP PLAN: Alternative Platforms
If Vercel continues having issues, these are ready to deploy:

**Railway (Full backend support):**
- Uses `railway.json` configuration
- Supports contact form
- $5/month

**Netlify (Static hosting):**
- Uses `netlify.toml` configuration  
- Free tier available
- Drag & drop deployment option

The simplified Vercel config should resolve the 404 issue immediately once redeployed.
