# VERCEL QUICK FIX - Entry Module Error Resolved

## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Vercel build failing with: `Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"`

**Root Cause:** Vercel can't find the correct entry point due to complex project structure.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Update vercel.json on GitHub
Replace your `vercel.json` content with:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public", 
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### Option 2: Use Netlify (Fixed Version)
Update `netlify.toml` with:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm install && vite build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
