# REPLIT DEPLOYMENT ERROR FIX

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Your Replit deployment is configured for "autoscale" deployment but failing during build. The error you're seeing is because:

1. **Wrong Deployment Type**: Your `.replit` file has `deploymentTarget = "autoscale"` 
2. **Build Command Issue**: The `npm run build` includes backend compilation that's not needed for static site
3. **Port Configuration**: Autoscale expects a running server, but you need static file serving

## SOLUTION STEPS

### 1. Change Deployment Type (Manual)
You need to manually update your `.replit` file:

**Current:**
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

**Change to:**
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "static"
build = ["vite", "build"]
publicDir = "dist/public"
```

### 2. How to Update .replit File:
1. In your Replit workspace, click on `.replit` file
2. Change `deploymentTarget = "autoscale"` to `deploymentTarget = "static"`
3. Change `build = ["npm", "run", "build"]` to `build = ["vite", "build"]`
4. Remove the `run = ["npm", "run", "start"]` line
5. Add `publicDir = "dist/public"`

### 3. Alternative: Use GitHub/Railway
If Replit deployment continues to have issues:

**GitHub Pages (Free):**
- Upload the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file I created
- Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- Auto-deploys from GitHub

**Railway (3 minutes):**
- Visit https://railway.app
- Deploy from GitHub repository
- Zero configuration required

## WHY STATIC DEPLOYMENT IS CORRECT
Your Keystone Infra website is a React SPA that builds to static files. You don't need a running server (autoscale) - you need static file hosting.

After changing to static deployment, click the Deploy button in Replit and it should work correctly.
