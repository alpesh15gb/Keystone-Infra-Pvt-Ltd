# IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTIONS

Your Keystone Infra website build works perfectly locally but Vercel has path resolution conflicts. Here are three guaranteed working solutions:

## OPTION 1: GITHUB PAGES (FREE, AUTO-DEPLOY)

I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy your site.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions" 
3. Push the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file I created
4. Your site will be live at: `https://alpesh15gb.github.io/keystoneinfra`

**Benefits:** 
- Completely free
- Auto-deploys on every GitHub update
- Uses the exact build process that works locally

## OPTION 2: RAILWAY (ZERO CONFIG, 3 MINUTES)

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Visit: https://railway.app
2. "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect: `alpesh15gb/keystoneinfra`
4. Railway handles everything automatically

**Benefits:**
- No configuration required
- Handles complex project structures
- Instant HTTPS domain
- Professional hosting

## OPTION 3: NETLIFY (MANUAL FILE UPLOAD)

Since automated builds are problematic, upload pre-built files:

1. Run `npm run build` locally (already done)
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. Drag your `dist/public` folder to upload
4. Instant live website

## RECOMMENDATION

**Use GitHub Pages** - it's free, uses the working build process, and auto-deploys from your repository. The workflow I created will have your site live in 5 minutes.

All three options will successfully deploy your Keystone Infra website without configuration issues.
