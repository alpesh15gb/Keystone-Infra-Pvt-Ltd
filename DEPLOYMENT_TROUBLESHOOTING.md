# Keystone Infrastructure Website - Deployment Access Guide

## üåê How to Access Your Website

### Option 1: Direct Replit URL
Your website should be accessible at one of these URLs:
- `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co`
- Look for the **"Open in new tab"** button in your Replit preview
- Copy the URL from the preview window

### Option 2: Through Deployments Tab
1. Click **"Deployments"** in your Replit sidebar
2. If you see an active deployment, click the **URL/domain** shown
3. This gives you the public deployment URL

### Option 3: Share Your Repl
1. Click the **Share** button in your Replit workspace
2. Copy the **"Share link"** provided
3. This allows public access to your running application

## üîß If Still Getting Login Redirect

This happens when:
1. **Project is Private**: Newer Replit accounts default to private projects
2. **No Active Deployment**: The project needs to be properly deployed
3. **Wrong URL**: Using internal development URLs

## ‚úÖ Quick Test

Try these steps in order:

1. **Copy Preview URL**:
   - Look at your preview pane in Replit
   - Copy the full URL from the address bar
   - Open it in a new incognito/private browser window

2. **Use Share Feature**:
   - Click "Share" in Replit
   - Copy the share link
   - Test in a different browser

3. **Check Deployments**:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Look for any active deployments
   - Use the deployment URL if available

## üöÄ Alternative: Quick Public Access

If the above doesn't work, you can:
1. Fork your project (this makes a public copy)
2. Or deploy to Vercel/Netlify using the configuration files we created

Your Keystone Infrastructure website is working perfectly - we just need to find the right public access method for your specific Replit setup.
