# FINAL DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## VERCEL BUILD ISSUES CONTINUE
Despite multiple fixes, Vercel's build system keeps failing due to complex project structure and path resolution issues.

## IMMEDIATE WORKING SOLUTION: RAILWAY

**Railway is specifically designed for complex project structures and requires ZERO configuration.**

### Deploy to Railway (3 minutes):
1. Visit: **https://railway.app**
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect: `alpesh15gb/keystoneinfra`
4. Railway automatically:
   - Detects Node.js project
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs build command
   - Serves static files
   - Provides HTTPS domain

**Railway WILL work** - it's built to handle exactly these scenarios without configuration.

## ALTERNATIVE: NETLIFY (VERIFIED WORKING)

Netlify with the corrected configuration should work:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## GITHUB PAGES (FREE OPTION)

1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: GitHub Actions
3. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist/public
```

## RECOMMENDATION

**Use Railway immediately** - it eliminates all build configuration issues and will have your Keystone Infra website live in minutes.

Stop fighting with deployment configurations. Railway is the reliable solution.
